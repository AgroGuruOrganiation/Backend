# AgroGuru - Empowering Farmers with Crop Prediction and Agricultural Information

AgroGuru is a comprehensive web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It aims to assist farmers by providing accurate crop predictions through Machine Learning, delivering real-time weather information, and offering resources such as nearby laboratories, markets, and nurseries to make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Crop Prediction:** Utilizes Machine Learning algorithms to predict optimal crops based on various factors.
- **Weather Information:** Real-time weather updates and forecasts for better agricultural planning.
- **User Roles:** Supports different user roles - farmer, crop seller, with tailored features.
- **Location-based Information:** Provides details about nearby laboratories, markets, and nurseries.
- **Database Integration:** Stores user data, predictions, and other essential information using MongoDB.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js with JavaScript for interactive user interfaces.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for server-side logic and APIs.
- **Database:** MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Machine Learning:** ML algorithms for crop prediction.
- **Weather Data:** Integration with weather APIs for real-time weather information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgroGuru.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AgroGuru`
